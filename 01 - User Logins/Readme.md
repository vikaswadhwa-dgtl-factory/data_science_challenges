# Data Science Challenge - Visitor Logins
We suggest spending 1-2 hours on this, but you're welcome to spend more or less. This is your chance to wow us with creative and rigorous solutions! Please include your code via zipped attachment via email, or as a pull request on this repository. We also accept incomplete solutions.

Please send us a brief writeup of your findings (the more concise, the better), along with any summary tables, graphs, code, or queries that can help us understand your approach. Please note any factors you considered or investigation you did, even if they did not pan out. Feel free to identify any further research or data you think would be valuable.


## Data Sources
Datasets are available under the local `./data` folder.


### `logins.json`
The attached logins.json file contains (simulated) timestamps of user logins in a particular geographic location.


## The Problem
Aggregate these login counts based on 15Â­ minute time intervals, and visualize and describe the resulting time series of login counts in ways that best characterize the underlying patterns of the demand.

Please report/illustrate important features of the demand, such as daily cycles.

If there are data quality issues, please report them.
