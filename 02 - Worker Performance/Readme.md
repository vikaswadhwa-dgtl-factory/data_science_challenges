# Data Science Challenge - Worker Performance
We suggest spending 1-2 hours on this, but you're welcome to spend more or less. This is your chance to wow us with creative and rigorous solutions! Please include your code via zipped attachment via email, or as a pull request on this repository. We also accept incomplete solutions.

Please send us a brief writeup of your findings (the more concise, the better), along with any summary tables, graphs, code, or queries that can help us understand your approach. Please note any factors you considered or investigation you did, even if they did not pan out. Feel free to identify any further research or data you think would be valuable.


## Data Sources
Datasets are available under the local `./data` folder.

### **workers.csv**
1. **`Worker ID`**: a unique identifier for each worker in the dataset.
2. **`Worker Name`**: worker name.
3. **`Hire Date`**: date worker was hired.
4. **`Worker Status`**: category of worker employement.  Values can be full time, part time, and per diem.
5. **`Team`**: team the worker is assigned to.

### **widgets.csv**

1. **`Item Number`**: identifier for each widget in the dataset.
2. **`Step 1`**: amount of time taken for this step in the widget making process.
3. **`Step 2`**: amount of time taken for this step in the widget making process.
4. **`Step 3`**: amount of time taken for this step in the widget making process.
5. **`Worker ID`**: key to worker id in the workers.csv file.



## The Problem
This is an exploratory data analysis problem; we do not have any firm expectations on the format of your final deliverable, we would love for you to explore, analyze, visualize and interpret the provided data in ways you think could add value.

The main objective of this exercise is for us to get an understanding of the questions you ask in this process, how you go about answering them, and any insights you draw. Please provide as much context as possible on how you've gotten to your conclusions!

You will need explore the two datasets containing worker data from our widget factory and report back with your analysis.

If there are data quality issues, please report them.
